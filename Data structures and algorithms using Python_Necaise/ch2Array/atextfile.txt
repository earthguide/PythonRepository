This month I held a Q&A at PuPPy (the Puget Sound Python users group) that eventually led to me explaining why Python 3 came into existence and the whole string/bytes deal. I ended up receiving a compliment on the explanation which somewhat surprised me since I naively assumed people knew at this point why Python 3 was created. In hindsight it was silly of me to assume a majority of people, new or old to Python, would have either been told or honestly been struck with the curiosity to seek out and find an explanation. So this blog post is meant to simply explain why Python 3 exists, and specifically why we chose to make the whole backwards-incompatible unicode/str/bytes change happen since that's the really tricky part in porting code to Python 3.
